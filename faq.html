    <h1># Frequently asked questions</h1>
    <p>Here are some questions that were asked to me, or that I would like to see answered if I was a visitor.</p>
    <h2>## About this website</h2>
    <h3>### Why does it look so bare-bones?</h3>
    <p>I like doing things myself, so I hand-write all of this website. It would be harder for me to maintain it if it wasn't simple. Also, I am preparing the site to be also available on Gemini at some point, so I use the same kind of styling than what is available in gemtext. I envision for this website to be JS-free, and without any trackers.</p>
    <h3>### The plain white background hurts my eyes. Can you add a dark mode?</h3>
    <p>For the same reason as above, I don't want to force things onto the users. This means that you are free to go in the settings of your browser, and change the default colors. Also, I use an extension named Dark Reader, that can add a dark mode to any website. I am using it, and the bare-boneness of my website makes it so that there is no problem in converting my website to dark.<br/>
    I know that I could use some CSS trickery to change the background to dark and the test to clear, but again, enerybody has its own prefernces, and the choices I could make are not the ones someone else would make.</p>
